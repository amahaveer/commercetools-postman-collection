# Getting started

This document provides instructions for installing Postman, for importing Composable Commerce Postman Collections, and for setting up an environment to get you started.

> **:warning: Note:**
>
> - Be aware that Postman automatically synchronizes environment variables (including your API Client credentials) to your workspace if logged in.
> - Use these collections only for development purposes and non-production projects.

## Install Postman

Instructions for installing the Postman app or using the web version can be found at [Installing and Updating](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/) in the Postman Learning Center.

## Set up an environment via the Composable Commerce API Client

An environment is a set of variables that you can use in your Postman queries. It can be generated and downloaded from the Merchant Center using the API Client to match your project:

1. Create an API Client following the instructions provided in [Create an API Client](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/api-clients#create-an-api-client) in the Merchant Center documentation.
1. After clicking **Create API Client**, scroll down to the bottom.
1. Choose **Postman** from the dropdown menu.
1. Click the **Download** icon.

   This downloads a Postman environment file containing all relevant data for your project.

1. In Postman, click **File** > **Import** and upload the environment obtained from the Merchant Center.

   The environment can now be chosen from the environment selector at the top-right of Postman.

## Set up an environment manually

Every root folder in [Platform API](api/), [Import](import/) and [Machine Learning](ml/) contains a `template.json` file.
To set up an environment using these templates, perform the following steps:

1. Import the `template.json` file, see [Importing data into Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-data-into-postman) in the Postman Learning Center for further details.

   This will create an empty variable set environment.

1. Set the initial values for primary variables:

   - `host`: The host information can be [found here](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/general-concepts#hosts).
   - `auth_url`: The Authorization URL can be [found here](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/authorization#requesting-an-access-token-using-commercetools-oauth-20-server).
   - `client_id`: From your API Client. More information can be [found here](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/api-clients#create-an-api-client).
   - `client_secret`: From your API Client.
   - `project_key`: Your project key.

   The environment is now ready to be used and can be chosen from the environment selector at the top-right of Postman.

## Import Composable Commerce Postman Collections

Each of the following folders contain a `collection.json` file: [Platform API](api/), [Import](import/) and [Machine Learning](ml/).
You can import these files into Postman, for details see [Importing data into Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-data-into-postman) in the Postman Learning Center.

After the import, you should be able to see the collection. Expanding the collection reveals two primary folders:

- **Authorization** - Use "Obtain access token" to get an authentication token. This is required for using the endpoints provided in the **Project** folder.
- **Project** - Ready to use, explore the endpoints.

You can now use the Composable Commerce Postman Collections.
